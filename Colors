If you have multiple color powers you can combine them to create custom colors:

====You can mix multiple colors, for example:====

:(smile#gb) red and green makes the smilie a cyan color

====You can have different amounts of each color, for example:====

:(smile#rrg) 2 parts red and 1 part green makes an orange color

====You can make the color lighter or darker, for example:====

:(smile#b+++) blue with 3 light makes a light blue

:(smile#b---) blue with 4 dark makes a light blue

====Alternatively you can use hex color codes, for example:====

:(smile#800080) - for purple

If you dont have the necessary color powers the chatbox will do the best it can to make the color requested.

You can find hex colour codes at [http://xatalert.com/colour-chooser/ xatAlert]

====Saving your color:====

If you want all your smilies to be colored without having to type in the code every time use the /o command.<BR>
e.g. for red smiles type /or  in the chat
