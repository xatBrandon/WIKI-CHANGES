Replace * with the amount of time in hours you want the person to be a moderator. Decimals are acceptable. Examples: /m1.5 (One hour and 30 minutes), /m.1 (6 minutes), /m20 (20 hours). If the "tempmod" is signed in while their mod rank expires, they will remain moderators until they change their name/avatar, sign in and out, or attempt to kick/ban/un-ban/guest/member someone (Making their moderator rank after their time expires almost worthless), after which they will be made members. If the tempmod is signed out while their mod rank expires, they will be members upon return (Unless of course the chat was reset, or someone made them a guest while they were away).

If used in conjunction with subhide, this power will remove the "registered" message from your account window. For instance if you have both enabled it might say "On xat BFF" instead of "On xat registered BFF". Note: If you are not using subhide then "Subscriber" will still appear in your account window.

You can use mirrored smilies in your name, messages, or as your main avatar picture, but not as an addition effect to an avatar (For instance yourpic.png#blood#m wouldn't work).

===http://xat.com/images/smw/subhide.png (subhide) - Hide subscriber (Black star)=== <!--T:315-->

<!--T:316-->
*This power makes the star/cross/heart on your "pawn" black (Instead of the gold/red that it would be while you're subscribed) while keeping all the normal subscriber abilities (Such as glitter, the subscriber only emotions, etc.)

===http://xat.com/images/smw/topman.png (topman) - Go to top of section=== <!--T:318-->

<!--T:319-->
*This will make you appear higher on the visitors list than people who have the same rank as you (For instance If you're a member you'll appear higher than other members), unless they also have topman, have purple, or are married/BFF to a person of a higher rank. You'll still appear lower than "friends" of the person viewing the chat if you're the same rank. You'll also appear lower than people appear to themselves, since everyone appears to be on the top of the visitors list to themselves. 

<!--T:320-->
*If someone else on the same rank as you has topman, then who is the top of those people will be determined by: Whether they have a BFF/Married person who is higher; whether or not they have purple power; whether or not they have a short name; whether or not they're on xat or online; whether or not they're using reghide; and ID number.

Unlike other powers, other users can not see whether or not you have the allpowers power enabled when they click on your name and click on "Powers". You can not trade allpowers by itself. If new powers are created that you don't have, you may lose allpowers.

<!--T:324-->
*You can use the secondary allpowers smilie (hmm#allpowers#w1)

=== (everypower) - The rarest power ever.=== <!--T:325-->

*The R in the hat code must be uppercase for it to work.
*Note your pawn when you send messages will always be the shiny ruby color unless you turn (everypower) off.
*You cannot trade this power, you must trade every power individually.
*See [http://util.xat.com/wiki/index.php/EveryPower EveryPower] for all information.
