>> Details

We'd prefer if articles submitted are in great detail. This is an example of a post with great detail: "Heart power lets you make heart-shaped smilies by typing (smile#h). You can also change the color by typing (smile#h#b) if you have color powers." This is a bad example: "Heart power lets you do heart smilies."

>> Proper Spelling / Grammar

If your article has a lot of spelling or grammar issues, it will require a lot of editing before we can put it up. Here is an example of a post that does not fit this requirement: "Phishing is wen a user makes u go to a fake xat site and u login and they get ur pass." However, this is much better: "Phishing is when a user instructs you go to a site that looks like xat when it is really a fraudulent website trying to steal your private information."

>> Credit

You might not get acknowledged on the wiki for your work, especially if it's a minor addition to an already-existing article. Please don't take it personal! We can't have names pasted all over articles or they'll look messy.
However, we have implemented a Special Thanks page that we may list you on if you submit enough edits to us.

>> Notes

The xat wiki volunteers may alter your submissions in any way before submitting, regardless if you're being credited or not. We may alter it if you didn't give enough detail or if you didn't use proper spelling or grammar. Your submission could also be rejected for any reason. Please note: xat reserves full rights over the use of the submitted articles.

>> Submitting

Put your article into http://xat.com/ticket in the General department to submit it to us. Title it "xat wiki submission" or any variation on that, and we'll look at it shortly!
