>> Details

We'd prefer if articles submitted are in great detail, example "Heart power lets you do heart smilies" is not as good as "Heart power lets you change smilies into heart-shaped, by typing (smile#h). You can also change the color by typing (smile#h#b) if you have color powers."

>> Proper Spelling / Grammar

If your article has lots of spelling errors, or grammar issues, it will require lots of editing before we can put it up. Example "phishing is wen a user makes u go to a fake xat site and u login and they get ur pass" is not going to be as good as "Phishing is when a user makes you go to a fake xat.com site, and you login and then they can view your password."

>> Credit

You might not get acknowledged on the wiki for your work, especially if its a minor addition to an already-existing article. Please don't take it personal! We can't have names pasted all over articles or they'll look messy.
However we have implemented a Special Thanks page that we may list you on if you submit enough edits to us.

>> Notes

The xat wiki volunteers may alter your submissions in any way before submitting, regardless if you're being credited or not. We may alter it if you didn't give enough detail or if you didn't use proper spelling / grammar. Also we may not publish your article for any reason. Please note by submitting your article to us you give us full rights to use it / link to it on any portion of xat.com.

>> Submitting

Put your article into http://xat.com/ticket in the General department to submit it to us. Title it "xat wiki submission" or any variation on that, and we'll look at it shortly!
