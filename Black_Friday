===Black Friday on xat===

Special limited power releases sometimes occur on xat for Black Friday. These sales are usually unannounced and are definitely not guaranteed.

===Sale Methods===

xat has used various methods for releasing powers on Black Friday. For example, the first Black Friday event, held in 2010, featured the release of 500 angel powers at 2000 xats per power. This price was significantly lower than the market value at the time.

However, xat has used, and continues to develop, new and interesting ways to release powers. There's no telling of the methods to come!

===Market Effects===

Both the regular and limited power markets are affected leading up to Black Friday.  

Usually, limited and epic power prices decline rapidly the month before Black Friday. This happens because people often feel inclined to collect a large amount xats in preparation for buying specially-released limited powers at a cheap price, thus the demand for having pure xats rises significantly. Even purple, a non-limited power, has been known to decrease to near 20000 xats despite its regular market price of 24000-24900 xats.
